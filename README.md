# 🔧 Building
This project uses [Premake](https://premake.github.io/). It's a project generator configured with Lua scripts.

The first thing you'll want to do is to run the `init.sh` script. This is a bash script that fetches/builds the premake executable that we'll use to generate our project files. If you are on Windows and don't have any way of running bash scripts, [simply download the latest executable from their website](https://premake.github.io/download.html) and put it in the root directory of the project.

To generate files for your favorite IDE or build system, simply run the premake executable like so:</br>
`premake5.exe vs2019` (Windows)</br>
`./premake5 codelite` (Unix)
